> https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Steampunk/auto-testing/wiki/Y08
> On the Wiki above you will find the service key you need to create an ABAP Cloud project in ADT.
> 
> You can log on to the system eitehr by using your personalized user (members of Harald Kuck's organization get such a user automatically) or

3. Right-click **`ZDMO_GEN_RAP630_SINGLE`**, select **Run As** > **ABAP Application (Console) F9**.

4. Now your packages `ZRAP630_###` and `ZRAP630_###_EXT` are created (where the suffix `###` denotes your group number and will contain everything you need. 
   Stay tuned and check the ABAP console. 

5. **âš Copy the package names and the suffix for later use.**   
   In the "Project Explorer" right click on **Favorite Packages** and click on **Add Package...**.
